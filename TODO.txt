select * from users, sellers where user_handle = seller_handle :^)


pulled seller handle, just need to adjust to where it pulls for a specific item. Map it to the defined sales person. So, seller_handle = item_seller_handle and so on.


Item handle is attached to seller handle, to match specifically for one seller.


Create a seperate table that houses the seller information + item information in order to create a list of orders for each individual logged in.
This way we can pull certain information that shows up on the order history tab.

order, item, sale time, quantity, seller, etc. 

pass user id into command, repo, and endpoint.

select * from item_seller_order where user_handle = :id


=== FOR NEXT WEEK ===
insert ID into your axios wrapper

look under specific ID from DB, SELECT * FROM orders WHERE purchase_handle = ${id};

return order information from that backend promise that is specific to the user.

That should be your order page fully finished and ready.

PROFILE PAGE
=============
Be able to update user settings VIA form, set placeholder as default value.

this will be using a .post, as we are updating large chunks of data this time.

this can be tied in with the user settings, but im a lazy fuck and already made
the page so its staying under settings. WEW

ORDER_ITEMS
============
Here is the join for multiple orders and items, try to piece this one together!

select oi.order_id, array_agg(oi.item_id) as items, array_agg(oi.quantity) as quantities, array_agg(i.name) as names from order_items as oi join orders as o on oi.order_id = o.order_id join items as i on oi.item_id = i.item_id where o.buyer_handle = '037b4897-8a2a-46b6-8ed7-47a555bb40f2' group by oi.order_id;

its a mess , gross.
Refer to how he set it up on teams. Should give you some insite on how this should even work.
