# project-pupper-shopping
This is a project for Helio Traning, a coding bootcamp I am currently attending. This project is a blank boilerplate that was given from the instructer and we were told to build upon. This is my current build.
# To Start
chmod +x ./stop

chmod +x ./start

chmod +x ./postgresql

These will give you the ability to start and stop the 3 docker containers, with one simple script file. You can even access the 
database if needed.
